# nu-spline

Spherical nu-spline interpolation.

Implementation based on the paper "Î½-Quaternion Splines for the Smooth
Interpolation of Orientations" by Gregory M. Nielson, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS, VOL. 10, NO. 2, MARCH/APRIL 2004.

The code is based on the Boost geometry, in particular the Geometry package.

Compile with:
  
  g++ driver.cpp

and execute with:

  ./a.out config

Different running configurations are to be implemented via configuration files, refer to the example present.

In subsequent versions the structure of the branch will hopefully improve.
